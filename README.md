# PGP_firstProject
This a simple proof of concept project -using didisoft java api to make a PgpKeyStore with privatekey and public key and use it to Decrypt and encrypt a message

The private key and the keystore are not part of the git project -one must be made:
Simply use Kleopratra (http://www.gpg4win.org/) to generate an new pgp-keypair save the private key (called Secret key in kleopratra ) and the public key to files and use the files as input to this project...

-the passwords ae in a properties file -you will have to make this aswell...
